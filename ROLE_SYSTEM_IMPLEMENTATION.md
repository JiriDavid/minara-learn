## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### Role Permissions Matrix
```javascript
ADMIN: [
  'view_all_users',
  'manage_users', 
  'manage_all_courses',
  'view_analytics',
  'system_settings'
]

INSTRUCTOR: [
  'create_courses',
  'manage_own_courses',
  'view_own_students',
  'grade_assignments',
  'view_course_analytics'
]

STUDENT: [
  'enroll_courses',
  'view_enrolled_courses', 
  'submit_assignments',
  'view_own_progress'
]
```

### Dashboard Routes
- **Admin**: `/dashboard/admin`
- **Instructor**: `/dashboard/lecturer` (maintaining existing structure)
- **Student**: `/dashboard/student`

### API Route Updates
- All authentication routes now support the 3-role system
- Legacy "lecturer" references updated to "instructor"
- Role validation added to protected endpoints
- Enhanced error handling and logging

## ðŸš€ How to Test

### 1. **Signup Process**
1. Navigate to `/auth/signup`
2. Fill in details and select role from dropdown
3. Submit form - user should be created with selected role

### 2. **Role-Based Navigation**
1. Sign up as different roles
2. Check navigation bar for role-specific items:
   - Admin: Should see "Admin Panel" link
   - Instructor: Should see "Instructor Tools" link
   - Student: Standard navigation only

### 3. **Dashboard Access**
1. After login, users should automatically redirect to their role-specific dashboard
2. Check user dropdown shows correct role information

### 4. **Database Verification**
```sql
-- Check role constraints are working
INSERT INTO profiles (id, email, full_name, role) VALUES 
(uuid_generate_v4(), 'test@example.com', 'Test User', 'invalid_role');
-- Should fail with constraint violation
```

## ðŸ“‹ Migration Notes

### Database Changes Required
1. Apply role constraints: Run `scripts/role-management-schema.sql`
2. Update existing "lecturer" roles to "instructor" if needed
3. Verify RLS policies are working correctly

### Environment Setup
- No additional environment variables required
- Existing Supabase setup supports the new role system

## ðŸ”’ Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Admins can view/manage all profiles
- Instructors can view student profiles in their courses
- Students can only manage their own profiles

### API Protection
- All protected routes check user role
- Instructor routes accept both "instructor" and "admin" roles
- Admin routes require exact "admin" role

### Client-Side Protection
- Navigation items conditionally rendered based on role
- Dashboard routing prevents unauthorized access
- Auth context provides role checking utilities

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Role Management Interface**: Admin panel for changing user roles
2. **Course Assignment**: Restrict course creation by role
3. **Advanced Permissions**: Granular permission system
4. **Audit Logging**: Track role-based actions
5. **Role Hierarchy**: Define role inheritance patterns
